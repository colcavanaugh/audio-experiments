# Phase 2 RED Tests Summary - Naughty and Tender

## Status: RED PHASE COMPLETE

All tests are written and FAILING as expected. This is the correct state for Test-Driven Development.

## Test Statistics

- **Total Tests**: 71
- **Test Code Lines**: ~1,892 lines
- **Compilation Status**: 83 compile errors (expected - no implementation exists yet)

## Test Organization

### 1. Oscillator Tests (`src/oscillators.rs`)
**Lines**: 386
**Tests**: 22

**Coverage**:
- Waveform generation (sine, sawtooth, square, triangle)
- Frequency accuracy validation (zero-crossing counts)
- Amplitude and range verification
- MIDI note to frequency conversion
- Phase accumulation and wrapping
- Edge cases:
  - Zero frequency
  - Negative frequency
  - Nyquist frequency
  - Above-Nyquist frequency
- Multiple oscillator independence
- Reset functionality
- Anti-aliasing documentation (future enhancement, test ignored)

**Key Test Methods**:
- `test_sine_wave_frequency_accuracy()` - Validates 440 Hz produces 880 zero crossings/sec
- `test_sawtooth_wave_range()` - Ensures sawtooth ramps -1 to +1
- `test_square_wave_duty_cycle()` - Verifies 50% duty cycle
- `test_phase_accumulation_wraps_correctly()` - Prevents phase overflow
- `test_nyquist_frequency_edge_case()` - Handles edge of valid frequency range

**Expected API**:
```rust
pub struct Oscillator {
    // Internal: sample_rate, phase
}

impl Oscillator {
    pub fn new(sample_rate: f32) -> Self;
    pub fn process_sine(&mut self, frequency: f32) -> f32;
    pub fn process_sawtooth(&mut self, frequency: f32) -> f32;
    pub fn process_square(&mut self, frequency: f32) -> f32;
    pub fn process_triangle(&mut self, frequency: f32) -> f32;
    pub fn reset(&mut self);
}
```

### 2. ADSR Envelope Tests (`src/envelope.rs`)
**Lines**: 567
**Tests**: 21

**Coverage**:
- Attack phase timing and shape (0 to 1 over time)
- Decay phase timing (1 to sustain level)
- Sustain phase hold behavior
- Release phase timing (current level to 0)
- Note on/off triggering
- Envelope state transitions (Idle → Attack → Decay → Sustain → Release → Idle)
- Velocity sensitivity
- Sample-accurate timing
- Edge cases:
  - Zero attack time (instant)
  - 100% sustain level (no decay)
  - Instant release
  - Release from attack/decay phases
  - Envelope retrigger
- Real-time safety (no allocations in `process()`)

**Key Test Methods**:
- `test_attack_phase_timing()` - Validates 100ms attack reaches 1.0
- `test_decay_phase_timing()` - Ensures decay reaches sustain level
- `test_sustain_phase_holds_level()` - Sustain holds indefinitely
- `test_release_phase_timing()` - Release returns to 0
- `test_envelope_state_transitions()` - State machine validation
- `test_sample_accurate_timing()` - Two identical envelopes produce identical output

**Expected API**:
```rust
pub struct ADSREnvelope {
    // Internal: state, levels, times, sample_rate
}

pub enum EnvelopeState {
    Idle,
    Attack,
    Decay,
    Sustain,
    Release,
}

impl ADSREnvelope {
    pub fn new(sample_rate: f32) -> Self;
    pub fn set_attack_ms(&mut self, time_ms: f32);
    pub fn set_decay_ms(&mut self, time_ms: f32);
    pub fn set_sustain_level(&mut self, level: f32); // 0.0 to 1.0
    pub fn set_release_ms(&mut self, time_ms: f32);
    pub fn note_on(&mut self, velocity: f32);
    pub fn note_off(&mut self);
    pub fn process(&mut self) -> f32; // Returns envelope value 0.0-1.0
    pub fn is_active(&self) -> bool;
    pub fn get_state(&self) -> EnvelopeState;
    pub fn reset(&mut self);
}
```

### 3. Voice Management Tests (`src/voice.rs`)
**Lines**: 543
**Tests**: 28

**Coverage**:
- Voice allocation on note on
- Voice deallocation on note off (after envelope completes)
- Polyphony (multiple simultaneous notes)
- Polyphony limits (8-16 voices configurable)
- Voice stealing strategies:
  - Steal oldest voice when limit reached
  - Prefer stealing releasing voices over active ones
- Voice state tracking (Idle, Active, Releasing)
- Each voice tracks its own:
  - MIDI note number
  - Envelope state
  - Oscillator phase
- Voice rendering and mixing (additive)
- Silence when no voices active
- Real-time safety:
  - Pre-allocated voice arrays
  - No allocations in `process()`
- Rapid MIDI event handling
- Voice reset

**Key Test Methods**:
- `test_voice_allocation_on_note_on()` - Note on allocates voice
- `test_polyphony_multiple_notes()` - Chord (C-E-G) allocates 3 voices
- `test_polyphony_limit()` - Enforces max voice count
- `test_voice_stealing_oldest_first()` - LRU voice stealing
- `test_voice_stealing_releasing_voice_first()` - Prefer releasing voices
- `test_voice_state_machine()` - Idle → Active → Releasing → Idle
- `test_voice_generates_correct_frequency()` - MIDI 69 (A4) = 440 Hz
- `test_voice_manager_process_produces_audio()` - Output is non-zero

**Expected API**:
```rust
pub struct Voice {
    // Internal: oscillator, envelope, note, state
}

pub struct VoiceManager {
    // Internal: voices array, voice count
}

pub enum VoiceState {
    Idle,
    Active,
    Releasing,
}

impl Voice {
    pub fn new(sample_rate: f32) -> Self;
    pub fn note_on(&mut self, note: u8, velocity: f32);
    pub fn note_off(&mut self);
    pub fn process(&mut self) -> f32;
    pub fn get_state(&self) -> VoiceState;
    pub fn reset(&mut self);
    pub fn set_waveform(&mut self, waveform: WaveformType);
    pub fn set_envelope_attack_ms(&mut self, time_ms: f32);
    pub fn set_envelope_decay_ms(&mut self, time_ms: f32);
    pub fn set_envelope_sustain_level(&mut self, level: f32);
    pub fn set_envelope_release_ms(&mut self, time_ms: f32);
}

impl VoiceManager {
    pub fn new(sample_rate: f32, max_voices: usize) -> Self;
    pub fn note_on(&mut self, note: u8, velocity: f32);
    pub fn note_off(&mut self, note: u8);
    pub fn process(&mut self, buffer: &mut [f32]);
    pub fn active_voice_count(&self) -> usize;
    pub fn releasing_voice_count(&self) -> usize;
    pub fn get_active_notes(&self) -> Vec<u8>;
    pub fn get_voice_states(&self) -> Vec<VoiceState>;
    pub fn max_voice_count(&self) -> usize;
    pub fn reset(&mut self);
}

pub enum WaveformType {
    Sine,
    Sawtooth,
    Square,
    Triangle,
}
```

### 4. Integration Tests (`tests/integration_tests.rs`)
**Lines**: 396
**Tests**: 13

**Coverage**:
- MIDI note on produces audio
- MIDI note off triggers release
- Polyphony produces mixed output (louder than single note)
- Different notes produce different frequencies (octave test)
- Velocity affects output amplitude
- Audio returns to silence after release
- Voice stealing maintains polyphony limit
- Envelope shapes amplitude over time (ADSR verification)
- Waveform selection produces different outputs
- No audio glitches on parameter changes
- Real-time safety (no panics, all samples finite)

**Key Integration Methods**:
- `test_midi_note_on_produces_audio()` - End-to-end MIDI → audio
- `test_polyphony_produces_mixed_output()` - Chord is louder than single note
- `test_different_notes_produce_different_frequencies()` - C5 is octave above C4
- `test_envelope_shapes_amplitude_over_time()` - ADSR envelope control
- `test_real_time_safety_no_panics()` - Stress test with 1000 random events

## Test Verification

Run tests to verify RED state:
```bash
cargo test --package naughty-and-tender
```

**Expected Output**:
```
error: could not compile `naughty-and-tender` (lib test) due to 83 previous errors; 3 warnings emitted
```

This is CORRECT for RED phase. Tests are failing because:
- `Oscillator` struct doesn't exist
- `ADSREnvelope` struct doesn't exist
- `EnvelopeState` enum doesn't exist
- `Voice` struct doesn't exist
- `VoiceManager` struct doesn't exist
- `VoiceState` enum doesn't exist
- `WaveformType` enum doesn't exist

## Next Steps for dsp-implementer

### Phase 2.1: Oscillators (GREEN)
1. Implement `Oscillator` struct in `src/oscillators.rs`
2. Implement basic waveform generation (sine, saw, square, triangle)
3. Run tests: `cargo test oscillators`
4. Make all oscillator tests pass

### Phase 2.2: Envelope (GREEN)
1. Implement `ADSREnvelope` struct in `src/envelope.rs`
2. Implement ADSR state machine

4. All 71 tests should pass

### Phase 2.5: Comprehensive Tests (COMPREHENSIVE)
After GREEN is achieved, dsp-test-writer will add:
- Performance benchmarks
- Additional edge cases discovered during implementation
- Regression tests for any bugs found
- Audio quality tests (THD, frequency response)

## Test Quality Standards

All tests follow DSP testing best practices:
- Frequency accuracy validated via zero-crossing counts
- Amplitude tested with RMS and peak measurements
- Timing verified sample-accurately
- Edge cases covered (zero, negative, Nyquist frequencies)
- Real-time safety verified (no allocations, no panics)
- State machines validated through all transitions
- Clear, descriptive test names
- Helpful assertion messages

## Files Modified
